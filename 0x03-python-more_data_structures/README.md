# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project is part of the Python curriculum and focuses on utilizing more advanced data structures â€” specifically sets and dictionaries. The tasks demonstrate Pythonic ways to manipulate these structures efficiently to solve a variety of problems.

### Learning Objectives
Understand how to use sets and dictionaries in Python

Differentiate between set operations like union, intersection, and difference

Work with dictionary key/value manipulation

Use comprehensions to transform data structures

Implement logic-heavy conversions like Roman numeral parsing


| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-square_matrix_simple.py` | Computes the square value of all integers in a matrix using a simple list comprehension. |
| `1-search_replace.py` | Replaces all occurrences of an element in a list with a new value. |
| `2-uniq_add.py` | Adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer). |
| `3-common_elements.py` | Returns a set of common elements in two sets. |
| `4-only_diff_elements.py` | Returns a set of all elements present in only one of the two sets. |
| `5-number_keys.py` | Returns the number of keys in a dictionary. |
