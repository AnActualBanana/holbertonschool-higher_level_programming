# 0x02. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Description
This project focuses on deepening your understanding of JavaScript, particularly the use of objects, variable scope, closures, and prototype-based inheritance. You'll implement and interact with object constructors, explore `this`, and practice manipulating data structures.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Explore the use of `this` and the lexical scope.
- Learn how closures work in JavaScript.
- Work with JavaScript objects and classes.
- Extend prototypes and create modular code.

## Project Files
Each file in this project contains a script that demonstrates or performs a specific task related to objects and scope.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-rectangle.js` | Defines an empty `Rectangle` class |
| `1-rectangle.js` | Adds a constructor to initialize width and height |
| `2-rectangle.js` | Adds condition to initialize only valid rectangles |
| `3-rectangle.js` | Adds a method `print()` to the class |
| `4-rectangle.js` | Adds methods `rotate()` and `double()` to manipulate the rectangle |
| `5-square.js` | Defines a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` |
| `6-square.js` | Adds an instance method `charPrint(c)` to print using a custom character |
| `7-occurences.js` | Defines a function that counts the number of occurrences in a list |
| `8-esrever.js` | Defines a function that reverses a list |
| `9-logme.js` | Prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument |
| `10-converter.js` | Converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument |

## Usage
To run any of the scripts, use:

node <filename>
