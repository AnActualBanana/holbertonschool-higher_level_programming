# Python Basics

## Description
This project covers fundamental Python concepts such as printing output, working with numbers, loops, conditionals, and functions. The scripts in this repository provide a hands-on approach to learning Python basics.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand Python's syntax and semantics.
- Learn how to use variables and operators.
- Work with loops and conditionals.
- Perform basic operations with functions.
- Handle user input and formatted output.
