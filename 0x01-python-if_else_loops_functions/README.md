# Python - Introduction to Python Programming

This project is part of the **Holberton School** curriculum and focuses on introducing fundamental concepts in Python programming. It includes small scripts that demonstrate basic syntax, control structures, and string manipulation in Python.

## Project Structure

Below is a list of all the files in this repository, along with a brief description of each:

| File Name            | Description                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `2-print_alphabet.py` | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding newline |
| `3-print_alphabt.py` | Prints the alphabet except letters `q` and `e` |
| `7-islower.py`       | Contains a function that checks for lowercase character |
| `7-main.py`          | Test file for `7-islower.py`                    |
| `8-uppercase.py`     | Contains a function that prints a string in uppercase |
| `8-main.py`          | Test file for `8-uppercase.py`                 |
| `README.md`          | Project description and file documentation     |
| `__pycache__/`       | Directory for compiled Python bytecode         |

## How to Use

Each script can be run individually using Python 3:

python3 filename.py

## Requirements
Python 3.x

A Unix-like operating system (Ubuntu 20.04 recommended)

PEP8 compliance (checked using pycodestyle)
