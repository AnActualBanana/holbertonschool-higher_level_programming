# 0x06. Python - More Classes and Objects

This project builds upon the previous exploration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It focuses on the use of more advanced class features such as instance methods, class attributes, string representation, comparison methods, and more â€” using a `Rectangle` class as the central example.

## Learning Objectives
Understand advanced class features in Python

Implement instance methods and special methods

Learn how to control the string representation of objects

Handle private attributes with getters and setters

Validate attributes and raise appropriate exceptions
