# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Description
This project is focused on JavaScript object-oriented programming. It explores concepts such as object creation, inheritance, closures, and scope in JavaScript. You'll also work with constructors, prototypes, and implement utility methods within objects.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the differences between global and local scope in JavaScript.
- Learn how to create and manipulate objects.
- Work with constructors and the `class` syntax.
- Understand and use closures.
- Define methods and use `this` keyword properly.
- Use `module.exports` and `require` for code organization.

## Project Files
Each file in this project is a JavaScript script that performs a specific task related to object-oriented JavaScript and closures.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-rectangle.js` | Defines an empty class `Rectangle` |
| `1-rectangle.js` | Adds constructor to initialize width and height |
| `2-rectangle.js` | Adds condition to create only valid rectangles |
| `3-rectangle.js` | Adds instance method `print()` that prints the rectangle using `X` |
| `4-rectangle.js` | Adds instance methods `rotate()` and `double()` |
| `5-square.js` | Defines a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` |
| `6-square.js` | Adds `charPrint(c)` method to `Square` to print with custom character |
| `7-occurences.js` | Defines a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list |
| `8-esrever.js` | Defines a function that reverses a list |
| `9-logme.js` | Defines a function that logs the number of times it has been called |
| `10-converter.js` | Defines a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base |

## Usage
To execute any of the scripts, use the following command:
```sh
node <script_name.js>
```
Example:
```sh
node 4-rectangle.js
```
